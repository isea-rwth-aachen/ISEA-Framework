Visualization      {#visualization}
==========
The following Matlab functions shall give a demonstrative view on the data generated by the simulation.
They can be found in the folder analysis.

In the same folder the function is in, a desciption of the function is saved.
The following functions need the inputparameters of the simulation solution, saved in the following files:<br/>
Patch_Areas.csv <br/>
Patch_Vertices.csv <br/>
Patch_Temperatures.csv <br/>
Those will be generated, if the ThermalVisualizer-tag is available in [Options](xmloption.html) of the config data.


- VisualizeCreatingPictures.m,	generates a series of pictures of the battery pack and saves them
- VisualizeMakingMovie.m,	genreates a video file from the result of the simulation (mpeg4)
- VisualizePlayingVideos.m,	generates a series of matlab plots which are supposed to look like they are a video

- PlotInit.m,	shows the initial thermal state of the pack (Script needs **quickvisualize.exe** to be in the same folder. This file can be copied from the bin folder.)
- PlotVideo.m,	shows a series of matlab plots similar to VisualizePlayingVideos.m
