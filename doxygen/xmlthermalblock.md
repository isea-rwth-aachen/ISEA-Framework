Thermal blocks     {#xmlthermalblock}
===================

All thermal blocks that are used in the thermal model are listed in the section below.
The structure of the corresponding xml element and a code example is given for each block.

Abstract
=========

![Possible geometrical blocks](all_cells.png)
Each thermal block can be specified by the attribute "class".
Each thermal block can posses the xml tag <**Heat**>.
The value indicated therein indicates the power loss in Watt.
If the power loss is set at another point in the simulation (e.g. in the electrical model or as input of the Simulink S-function), this value will be ignored.
